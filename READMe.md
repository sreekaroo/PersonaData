**PersonaData**

This Flask webapp allows for users to take the big 5 personality quiz and see how their results compare to other users, as well as 50 users from a Kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/big-five-personality-test). 


The results are stored in a mySQL database hosted through AWS. The actual flask application is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed through the url: https://persona-data.herokuapp.com/
