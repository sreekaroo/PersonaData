First begin by running the FinalDatabaseProject.sql script to get the database schema and data associated with it. Be sure to remember the
connection this database is stored under.

Now, navigate to the DatabaseProject directory and attempt to <pip install -r requirements.txt_ Now you should have all the
requirements necessary to run main.py.

Run main.py:

1. there should be prompts for you to input credentials regarding the connection to the database you should've
   downloaded already
2. Next, the flask app should begin running on your local host, simply click the link provided in the terminal or
